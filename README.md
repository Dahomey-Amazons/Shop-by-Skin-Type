# Enhanced Skincare and Makeup Section for Myntra

This project aims to enhance the existing skincare section on Myntra by addressing its limitations and adding new features to improve user experience. The improved section provides detailed skin analysis and recommends products along with a skincare routine based on various statistics and user inputs. Additionally, it extends these features to the makeup section.

## Existing Features on Myntra

Myntra already has a section where you can click your picture, and based on your picture, it provides the level of hyperpigmentation, skin tone, eye bags, skin shine, dullness, etc., using various statistics. However, there are some limitations:
- It does not have an ingredient section.
- It lacks preferences according to brands.
- It is only available in the skincare section and not in the makeup section.

## New Features

1. **Enhanced Skin and Makeup Analysis**: 
   - Analyzes hyperpigmentation, skin tone, eye bags, skin shine, dullness, etc.
   - Uses statistics and user inputs for precise recommendations.

2. **Expanded Preferences List**:
   - Includes a wider range of skin conditions and preferences.

3. **Improved UI**:
   - Redesigned interface for easy navigation to the skincare and makeup sections.

4. **Ingredient Filters**:
   - Users can specify ingredients they are allergic to.
   - Products without these ingredients are recommended.

5. **Brand Filters**:
   - Users can filter products by their preferred brands.

6. **Customized Product Recommendations**:
   - Based on a dataset of skin types and suitable ingredients.
   - Recommends products tailored to individual skin and makeup needs.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the webpage.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality and interactivity of the webpage.
- **Dummy Data**: Example data for ingredients and skin combinations.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**:
   - Users provide information about their skin type and conditions.
   - They can specify any allergies and preferred brands.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - The system processes the input data.
   - It cross-references the data with a pre-defined dataset of skin types and suitable ingredients.

3. **Product Recommendation**:

## Integration with Myntra

In the existing "Shop by Skin Type" section on Myntra, users can click their picture to receive various skin analysis metrics. Based on this analysis, a list of ingredients corresponding to suitable products will be shown to the user. Users can choose to view products that contain all ingredients by selecting all or deselect any unsuitable ingredients before proceeding. This integration aims to provide personalized product recommendations aligned with user preferences and skin analysis results.

## Future Improvements

- **Real-Time Integration**: Integrate real-time data from the Myntra API to enhance accuracy and relevance of product recommendations.
- **Machine Learning**: Implement machine learning models to further refine skin analysis and product matching algorithms.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Include user reviews and ratings to improve product selection accuracy and enhance user trust.
- **Expanded Dataset**: Continuously expand the dataset to include more ingredients, skin types, and product categories for broader user coverage.
